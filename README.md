# Option Pricing Python Library

A modular and extensible Python library for pricing vanilla and exotic options using a variety of models including Black-Scholes, binomial trees, and Monte Carlo simulation. It also supports market data retrieval and volatility modeling.

An interactive app is available to demonstrate uses of the package using the `streamlit` library.

Note: If the Streamlit app is asleep when you open it, just click *"Wake up"* and give it a few seconds to load. The app is hosted using the Streamlit Community Cloud so the app may fall asleep if it has been inactive for more than a few hours to save resources.
